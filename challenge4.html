        <h2>Kharkhoda</h2>
        <p class="k">Kharkhoda is a city and municipal committee in Sonipat district in the Indian state of Haryana and
            is a part of National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi. In Kharkhoda Chhapadeshwar Mahadev Mandir is very
            popular within the connected villages. At the time of Maha Shivratri festival a large number of tourists
            comes for visiting the temple. Due to the proximity of UT of Delhi, there is a lot of scope of industrial
            and residential development in the area. Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation
            acquired 3200 Acres of land to develop Industrial Model Township (IMT). Western Peripheral Expressway (KMP)
            is just 1km & Delhi–Amritsar–Katra Expressway is 5km away from the city. On 28 august 2022 Shri Narendra
            Modi laid foundation stone of Maruti Suzuki's new manufacturing plant in Kharkhoda. Khanda village of
            Kharkhoda block have a statue of Baba Banda Singh Bahadur (one of the great military commander of India)
            which was inaugurated by CM of Haryana Manohar Lal Khattar on Shaurya Diwas celebrated in Khanda,
            Sonipat.[1][2][3]

            Here Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb constructed a Mosque, which is now ruined. In Pre Partition days, Kharkhoda
            was the town of Muslim Sayyid Families, which are also called Mir. In 1947 they migrated to Pakistan. Famous
            Pakistani writer and researcher, Syed Qasim Mahmood, was born here.</p>

        <h2>Sonipat</h2>



        <p class="p">Reference to the city comes in the epic Mahabharata as Swarnprastha. It was one of the five Prastha
            demanded by Pandavas as the price of peace from Duryodhan in lieu of the kingdom Hastinapur. The other four
            Prastha were Vanprastha (Panipat), Vyaghraprastha (Baghpat), Tilprastha (Faridabad) and Indraprastha
            (Delhi).[11]

            Sonipat is listed in the Ain-i-Akbari as a pargana under Delhi sarkar, producing a revenue of 7,727,323 dams
            for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 1000 infantry and 70 cavalry. It had a brick fort at the
            time, which was also mentioned.[12]

            Sonipat came under Islamic rule after the Second Battle of Tarain in 1193. The Sikhs under Banda Singh
            Bahadur fought the Battle of Sonipat against the Mughals in 1709. Khanda, Sonipat village witnessed the
            Battle of Sonipat and won the battle against Mughals under the military leadership of Banda Singh
            Bahadur[13]</p>

    <div class="kharkhoda">
        <h2>Haryana</h2>
        <p class="k">The villages of Rakhigarhi in Hisar district and Bhirrana in Fatehabad district are home to ancient
            sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, which contain evidence of paved roads, a drainage system, a
            large-scale rainwater collection storage system, terracotta brick and statue production, and skilled
            metalworking (in both bronze and precious metals).[14]

            During the Vedic era, Haryana was the site of the Kuru Kingdom, one of India's great Mahajanapadas. The
            south of Haryana is the claimed location of Manu's state of Brahmavarta.[15][better source needed] The area
            surrounding Dhosi Hill, and districts of Rewari and Mahendragarh had Ashrams of several Rishis who made
            valuable contributions to important Hindu scriptures like Vedas, Upanishads, Manusmriti, Brahmanas and
            Puranas.[16] As per Manusmriti,[17] Manu was the king of Brahmavarta, the flood time state 10,000 years ago
            surrounded by oldest route of Sarasvati and Drishadwati rivers on the banks of which Sanatan-Vedic or
            present-day Hindu ethos evolved and scriptures were composed.</p>
